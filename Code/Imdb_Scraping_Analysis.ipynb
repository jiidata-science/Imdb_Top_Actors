    "## *Scraping movie and cast information from IMDb.com and visualising most featured actors/actresses, with BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Plotly*\n",
    "\n",
    "So here it is...my first data science article (hopefully not my last). I decided to kick-off my series with at IMDb's top rated films to identify actors/actresses that feature across multiple top films - the 'real movie stars'. To be brutally honest about *why* I've dived into this relatively random topic; primarily I wanted to use web scraping technology (i.e. Python with beautifulSoup in this case) to collect data that isn't otherwise readily available in the desired format. The secondary reason was merely because I enjoy watching movies - hardly a unique interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst IMDb's does readily offer APIs for accessing movie information (seems a little suprising to me) they do offer a number of static datasets - https://datasets.imdbws.com/. I chose not use these datasets and scraped required data directly from the IMDb.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) We start with scraping IMDb film, actors/actress data (using BeautifulSoup)\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) We process and clean the captured data (using Pandas)\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Then (more interestingly) we start to pull explore the data by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a) Looking at the distribution of Top 250 film ratings\n",
    "    (b) Understanding which film genres are more likely to have higher ratings, and\n",
    "    (c) Identifying which actors/actresses appear in the most top rated films\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Ultimately, this blog culminates in identifying *\"Which actors/actresses feature in the most Top 250 films?\"*. I began this project under the naive assumption that these actors/actresses would be popular household names; the likes of Katharine Hepburn, Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson. IMDb themselves provide a ranking of '100 greates actors & actresses' https://www.imdb.com/list/ls053085147/ BUT This analysis actually provides some suprising outcomes...enjoy!**\n"

    "\n",
    "- So this was the bit I was most interested in. Here we take a look at which actors and actresses appear (in the cast & crew listings) across all 250 movies, how many movies they appeared in and what those films were?\n",
    "- in the code snippet below we create an interactive plotly chart that allows the user to select the top N actors/actresses with the most film features. The film start with the highest number of features appear on the far left of the chart and appears in descending order.\n",
    "- Perhaps I'm not quite the film buff I first thought but, to my suprise, the first actor I had heard of was in position five - **Robert De Niro** - who has appeared in eight of the top 250 films and is undoubtably a household name. \n",
    "- Interestingly, **John Ratzenberger** has 'appeared' in more of the Top 250 movies than any other actor - a whopping 12 x movies. However, 10 x of these were animation films - so he didn't even 'appear' in them at all. **Bess Flowers**, in position two, featured in 10 of the Top 250 movies but all before the 1970s.\n",
    "- In third position, Joseph Oliveira, was an quirky find - whilst he's featured in 9 of the Top 250 movies, he's only played 'supporting' or uncredited roles in each. For example:\n",
    "Dark Knight - a walk on officer, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\n",
    "uncredited role as 'Marciano' in Goodfellas https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099685/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\n",
    "The Departed, again an uncredited Officer\n",
